# Quality Standards

## üéØ Purpose
This file contains common quality standards that ensure code quality, maintainability, and reliability across all projects.

## üß™ Testing Standards

### **Test Coverage Requirements**
- **ALWAYS implement tests** for all new business logic and service methods
- **ALWAYS create unit tests** for complex coordination logic
- **ALWAYS validate algorithms** with comprehensive testing
- **ALWAYS mock external dependencies** for isolated testing
- **ALWAYS test both positive and negative** scenarios
- **ALWAYS aim for 90%+ test coverage** for new functionality

### **Testing Principles**
- **NEVER change code to fix a test** unless the code has been proven broken by the test
- **ALWAYS write tests first** when implementing new features (TDD when possible)
- **ALWAYS test edge cases** and boundary conditions
- **ALWAYS test error conditions** and exception handling
- **ALWAYS use descriptive test names** that explain the scenario being tested

### **Test Implementation Patterns**
- **Use appropriate testing framework** for the technology stack
- **Mock external dependencies** (databases, external services, file systems)
- **Test both positive and negative** scenarios
- **Validate business logic edge cases**
- **Test async operations properly**
- **Use test data factories** for consistent test data

## üîí Code Quality Standards

### **Code Review Requirements**
- **ALWAYS do code review** to see what's already been implemented
- **ALWAYS verify current project state** before assuming what needs to be implemented
- **ALWAYS maintain consistency** with existing codebase patterns
- **ALWAYS follow established naming conventions**
- **ALWAYS ensure proper error handling** is implemented

### **Code Organization**
- **ALWAYS use consistent naming conventions** across the project
- **ALWAYS organize related functionality** into logical groups
- **ALWAYS maintain clear separation** between different concerns
- **ALWAYS use descriptive names** for files, classes, and methods
- **ALWAYS follow SOLID principles** when designing classes and interfaces

### **Code Documentation**
- **ALWAYS add XML documentation** to public APIs and interfaces
- **ALWAYS document complex algorithms** with clear explanations
- **ALWAYS include usage examples** in documentation
- **ALWAYS document assumptions** and limitations
- **ALWAYS keep documentation current** with code changes

## üö® Error Handling Standards

### **Error Handling Principles**
- **ALWAYS implement proper error handling** for all operations
- **ALWAYS log errors** with appropriate detail and context
- **ALWAYS provide user-friendly error messages** when appropriate
- **ALWAYS handle edge cases** and unexpected scenarios gracefully
- **ALWAYS fail fast** when errors cannot be recovered from

### **Logging Standards**
- **ALWAYS use structured logging** with correlation IDs
- **ALWAYS log at appropriate levels** (Debug, Info, Warning, Error, Fatal)
- **ALWAYS include context** in log messages
- **ALWAYS log business logic decisions** and state changes
- **ALWAYS use consistent log format** across the application

### **Exception Handling**
- **ALWAYS catch specific exceptions** rather than generic Exception
- **ALWAYS log exceptions** with full context and stack traces
- **ALWAYS handle exceptions gracefully** when possible
- **ALWAYS provide meaningful error messages** to users
- **ALWAYS consider security implications** of error messages

## üìà Performance Standards

### **Performance Considerations**
- **ALWAYS consider performance implications** of design decisions
- **ALWAYS profile critical paths** before optimization
- **ALWAYS measure before and after** any performance changes
- **ALWAYS prioritize correctness** over premature optimization
- **ALWAYS use appropriate data structures** for the use case

### **Performance Testing**
- **ALWAYS test performance** under realistic load conditions
- **ALWAYS establish performance baselines** for critical operations
- **ALWAYS monitor performance metrics** in production
- **ALWAYS optimize bottlenecks** identified through profiling
- **ALWAYS consider scalability** when designing systems

## üîß Maintenance Standards

### **Code Maintenance**
- **ALWAYS keep dependencies updated** to latest stable versions
- **ALWAYS remove unused code** and dependencies
- **ALWAYS refactor** when code becomes difficult to understand
- **ALWAYS maintain consistent coding style** across the project
- **ALWAYS address technical debt** in a timely manner

### **Refactoring Guidelines**
- **ALWAYS refactor in small, safe steps**
- **ALWAYS maintain test coverage** during refactoring
- **ALWAYS verify functionality** after each refactoring step
- **ALWAYS document significant refactoring** decisions
- **ALWAYS consider impact** on other team members

## üìä Quality Metrics

### **Code Quality Metrics**
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 90% for new code
- **Code Complexity**: Maintain cyclomatic complexity under 10
- **Code Duplication**: Keep duplication under 5%
- **Documentation Coverage**: 100% for public APIs
- **Code Review Coverage**: 100% for all changes

### **Performance Metrics**
- **Response Time**: Meet defined SLA requirements
- **Throughput**: Handle expected load with headroom
- **Resource Usage**: Stay within defined resource limits
- **Error Rate**: Keep errors under 1% for critical operations
- **Availability**: Meet defined uptime requirements

## üîç Quality Assurance Process

### **Code Review Checklist**
- [ ] Code follows established patterns and conventions
- [ ] Tests are written and passing
- [ ] Error handling is implemented appropriately
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Performance implications are considered
- [ ] Security implications are reviewed
- [ ] Code is readable and maintainable

### **Quality Gates**
- **Build Success**: All tests must pass
- **Code Coverage**: Minimum coverage requirements met
- **Code Review**: All changes reviewed and approved
- **Performance Tests**: Performance requirements met
- **Security Scan**: No security vulnerabilities detected
